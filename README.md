# Iris-Flower-Analysis

# Overview

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using Machine Learning Techniques. The classification is based on four key features:

1. Sepal Length

2. Sepal Width

3. Petal Length

4. Petal Width

The dataset used for training and testing is the Iris dataset, which is a well known dataset in Machine Learning.
